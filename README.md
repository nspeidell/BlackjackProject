# Blackjack Project
 The blackjack app works like a real game of blackjack.  It has a dealer, a player, and a deck of cards.  The cards are used duirng the game and are equivelant to a real deck of cards.  The dealer shuffles the cards, and deals according to game rules.  First thing he does is check for blackjack. 
 The app takes player input to make decisions on whther to hit or stay.  Once the player is complete the dealer will play his hand (dealer hits on 17).  The app then calcuates the cards and make a decision on the winner.  At any time if the player of dealer bust the game is over.
 The player has the option to play as many games until the deck runs out.

 # Lessons learned 
 This proejct chellegned me to great lengths.  I stared at the screen for hours trying to figure out wht to do.  Once i found a starting point i wrote the whe app.  However, I felt like something was off still.  I asked for help and the TA pointed me towards objects.  It finally clcked what objects actually meant.  At that point i was able to rewrite the whole app with a player, a dealer, deck of cards, pretty quickly as most of the logic was there.  
 I still struggle with adding to lists and arrays, that seems to take up a lot of time on each prejoct so far.
 Finally, continuing to review and revise the code to make all the little rules work correctly for each scenario was challgning and tedious.
